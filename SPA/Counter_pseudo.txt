Task: Ct - count to some limit.
	LDM1 - Load count limit. (No concern yet where this comes from)
	LDM2 - Load count step.
	LDM3 - Load vecor for 'TRUE' so that there is a standard of comparison.
	
	?? - Bind operands & operators.
	QMem - Query memory on whether attention > limit
	Cmp - Mem return and M3.
	If M3 is TRUE:
		LDAtt - Load '1' into attention
	Else:
		?? - Bind operands and 'NEXT' operator.
		QMem - Query memory
		LDAtt - Load memory return into attention.
